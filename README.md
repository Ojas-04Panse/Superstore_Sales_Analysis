# Superstore_Sales_Analysis
This Power BI project explores sales performance across different segments, categories, and geographies in a U.S.-based superstore dataset from 2011 to 2014.

Objectives :-
  I. Visualize key metrics such as total sales, profit, and quantity sold.
  II. Identify high-performing regions, categories, and shipping strategies.
  III. Understand the impact of discounting, shipping modes, and customer segments on profitability.

Key Insights :-
  1. Sales ≠ Profit
  While total sales were $2.3M, the total profit was only $286K — a margin of ~12%.
  Some categories like Tables and Bookcases had high sales but negative or low profit due to excessive discounting or high logistics costs.
  
  2. What Products Sell Best?
  Phones and Chairs topped the charts in sales, generating over $300K each.
  However, Copiers and Accessories offered the highest profit margins, indicating better ROI per unit sold.
  
  3. Which Regions Drive Revenue?
  West and East regions generated the highest sales and profits.
  Despite this, South and Central showed underperformance, especially in categories like Office Supplies.
  
  4. Shipping Mode Matters
  Standard Class accounted for 60% of orders, but Same Day and First Class shipping had better profit ratios.
  Second Class shipping was the least profitable, suggesting a mismatch in cost vs. revenue.
  
  5. Who Buys the Most?
  Consumer segment contributed the most to total sales, followed by Corporate and Home Office.
  However, Home Office customers showed higher profit per transaction — hinting at a smaller but more valuable customer base.

What This Tells Us
Profitability isn’t just about selling more — it’s about selling smarter.
Over-discounting leads to major losses, even in high-sales sub-categories.
Companies need to optimize shipping costs, focus on high-margin items, and better segment customers by long-term value, not just volume.
